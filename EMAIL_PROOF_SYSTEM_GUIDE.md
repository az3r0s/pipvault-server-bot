# Email Proof System Guide ðŸ“§ðŸ“¸

## Overview
The VIP upgrade system now includes an enhanced email proof workflow that automatically handles screenshot uploads and staff notifications.

## How It Works

### 1. User Initiates Email Proof
- User clicks "ðŸ“§ I have an existing account" in VIP upgrade channel
- System generates personalized email template with:
  - User's Discord username pre-filled
  - Staff member's IB code (from invite attribution)
  - Standard VIP upgrade request format

### 2. Email Template Generation
```
Subject: VIP Upgrade Request - [Username]

Dear Vantage Support,

I would like to request VIP access for my existing Vantage trading account.

Discord Username: [Auto-filled username]
Referring IB Code: [Staff member's IB code]

Please upgrade my account to VIP status.

Thank you,
[Username]
```

### 3. Enhanced Screenshot Upload Process

#### Previous System (Manual):
- User copies email template
- User sends email manually
- User manually uploads screenshot in Discord channel
- Staff manually reviews in channel

#### New System (Automated):
1. **Email Sent Confirmation**: User clicks "âœ… Email Sent" 
2. **Screenshot Upload Button**: System shows "ðŸ“¸ Upload Screenshot" button
3. **Upload Modal**: Click opens modal with "Ready" confirmation
4. **Automated Upload**: System prompts "Send your screenshot NOW!"
5. **Image Detection**: Bot automatically detects image attachments (60-second window)
6. **Instant Processing**: Screenshot is immediately processed and sent to staff DMs

### 4. Staff Notification Enhancement
- Staff receives DM with VIP request details
- **NEW**: Email proof screenshot is embedded directly in the DM
- Staff can approve/deny with buttons in their DM
- Auto VIP role assignment on approval

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

#### ImageUploadView
```python
class ImageUploadView(discord.ui.View):
    - Timeout: 30 minutes
    - Button: "ðŸ“¸ Upload Screenshot"
    - Prevents duplicate uploads
    - Integrates with request tracking
```

#### ImageUploadModal  
```python
class ImageUploadModal(discord.ui.Modal):
    - Instructs user to attach image
    - Sets up message listener
    - 60-second upload window
    - Automatic image detection
```

#### Enhanced Staff Notifications
- Image proof embedded in staff DM
