# Discord ID Mismatch Fix Guide üîß

## Issue Identified
The `/list_invite_users @Aidan` command shows "doesn't have an invite code configured" but `/list_staff_invites` shows Aidan DOES have invite code `MGnZk3KaUc`.

**Root Cause:** Discord ID mismatch - the database has a different Discord ID stored than Aidan's current ID.

## Solution: New Fix Command

### `/fix_staff_discord_id` Command
**Usage:** `/fix_staff_discord_id staff_member:@Aidan old_invite_code:MGnZk3KaUc`

**What it does:**
- Updates the Discord ID in the database to match the current user
- Preserves all existing invite data and tracking
- Fixes all related references (VIP requests, invite tracking)
- Automatically triggers cloud backup

## Step-by-Step Fix for Aidan

### Step 1: Fix Discord ID Mismatch
```
/fix_staff_discord_id staff_member:@Aidan old_invite_code:MGnZk3KaUc
```

### Step 2: Verify Fix Works
```
/list_invite_users staff_member:@Aidan
```
Should now show Aidan's invite details instead of "not configured"

### Step 3: Test Other Commands
```
/delete_staff_invite staff_member:@Aidan  (if needed)
/create_staff_invite staff_member:@Aidan  (if needed)
```

## Enhanced Debug Information

The `/list_invite_users` command now provides better debugging when it fails:

### New Error Display:
```
‚ùå Staff Member Not Found
Aidan doesn't have an invite code configured.

üîç Debug Info
Looking for Discord ID: 123456789012345678
Username: Aidan
Possible matches: 1

üîß Possible Discord ID Mismatch
‚Ä¢ Username: Aidan
  Discord ID: 987654321098765432  ‚Üê Different ID!
  Invite Code: MGnZk3KaUc

üí° Solution
Use /delete_invite_by_code MGnZk3KaUc to delete the old entry,
then /create_staff_invite to create a new one with correct ID.
```

## Why This Happens

### Common Causes:
1. **User left and rejoined server** - Gets new Discord ID
2. **Account changes** - User switched Discord accounts  
3. **Manual database edits** - ID was manually changed incorrectly
4. **Migration issues** - Data imported with wrong IDs

## Commands for Discord ID Issues

### Diagnosis:
- `/list_staff_invites` - Shows all configured invites
- `/list_invite_users @User` - Now shows debug info on failure
- `/debug_staff_database` - Shows raw database contents

### Fixes:
- `/fix_staff_discord_id @User code` - **NEW** - Fixes ID mismatch (preserves data)
- `/delete_invite_by_code code` - Deletes by code (if fix doesn't work)
- `/create_staff_invite @User` - Creates fresh invite

## Fix vs Delete/Recreate

### Use `/fix_staff_discord_id` when:
- ‚úÖ User has existing invite data you want to preserve
- ‚úÖ Users have already joined through their invite
- ‚úÖ VIP conversions exist that need attribution
- ‚úÖ You want to maintain historical data

### Use Delete/Recreate when:
- ‚ùå No existing users or data to preserve
- ‚ùå Complete fresh start is needed
- ‚ùå Fix command fails for some reason

## Expected Outcome

After running `/fix_staff_discord_id staff_member:@Aidan old_invite_code:MGnZk3KaUc`:

### Success Message:
```
‚úÖ Discord ID Updated Successfully
Fixed Discord ID mismatch for @Aidan

üîß Changes Made
Staff Member: @Aidan
Invite Code: MGnZk3KaUc
Old Discord ID: 987654321098765432
New Discord ID: 123456789012345678

‚úÖ What Works Now
‚Ä¢ /list_invite_users @Aidan will work
‚Ä¢ /delete_staff_invite @Aidan will work

```
