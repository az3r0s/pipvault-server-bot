🤖 FOUND THE SOLUTION! The bot has a built-in export command.

✅ TO BACKUP PRODUCTION DATA:

1. � In Discord, run this command:
   /export_staff_invites
   
   This will generate a complete backup file with:
   ✅ All 6 staff invite configurations
   ✅ All invite tracking data
   ✅ All VIP requests  
   ✅ Current statistics and mappings

2. 💾 Download the generated JSON backup file

3. �️ Keep this file safe as your production data backup

4. 🚀 Deploy the welcome system (the export ensures you can restore if needed)

5. � If needed after deployment, use:
   /import_staff_invites (upload the backup file)

💡 This export/import system is specifically designed for production data safety!
