# How to Delete Existing Staff Invites 🗑️

## Quick Solution

To delete the existing invites for Cyril and Fin G, use the new `/delete_staff_invite` command:

```
/delete_staff_invite staff_member:@Cyril
/delete_staff_invite staff_member:@FinG
```

## What This Does

### 1. **Removes Discord Invite**
- Finds the Discord invite link with their code
- Deletes it from the server (invalidates the link)
- Users can no longer use the old invite

### 2. **Clears Database Configuration**
- Removes invite code from staff configuration
- Cleans up tracking data
- Prepares for fresh invite creation

### 3. **Provides Status Report**
Shows you exactly what was cleaned up:
- ✅ Discord invite deleted
- ✅ Database configuration cleared
- 📝 Ready for new invite creation

## Complete Reset Workflow

### Step 1: Delete Old Invites
```
/delete_staff_invite staff_member:@Cyril
/delete_staff_invite staff_member:@FinG
```

### Step 2: Test DM Capability
```
/test_dm user:@Cyril
/test_dm user:@FinG
```

### Step 3: Fix DM Issues (if needed)
Ask them to enable: **User Settings → Privacy & Safety → "Allow direct messages from server members"**

### Step 4: Create Fresh Invites
```
/create_staff_invite staff_member:@Cyril
/create_staff_invite staff_member:@FinG
```

## Expected Output

When you run `/delete_staff_invite`, you'll see:

```
✅ Staff Invite Deleted
Successfully removed invite link for @Cyril

🗑️ Cleanup Status
Invite Code: abc123def
Discord Invite: ✅ Deleted
Database: ✅ Cleared

📝 Next Steps
You can create a new invite for @Cyril using /create_staff_invite
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Current Invites:
```
/list_staff_invites
```

### After Deletion:
- Cyril and Fin G should show no invite codes
- Or they should be completely removed from the list

### After Recreation:
- They should appear with new invite codes
- DM status will show success/failure

## Why This Approach?

### Clean Slate:
- Removes any corrupted or problematic invite data
- Ensures fresh configuration
- Eliminates any cached issues

### Better Debugging:
- New enhanced commands provide clear feedback
- You'll know exactly what's happening with DMs
- Manual fallback if DMs still fail

## Alternative: Mass Cleanup

If you want to clean up ALL staff invites and start fresh:

```
/cleanup_unauthorized_invites
```

This removes ALL invites except staff ones, but you can also manually delete all staff invites and recreate them.

## Summary

1. **Delete**: `/delete_staff_invite @Cyril` and `/delete_staff_invite @FinG`
2. **Test**: `/test_dm @Cyril` and `/test_dm @FinG` 
3. **Fix DMs**: Enable "Allow DMs from server members" if needed
4. **Recreate**: `/create_staff_invite @Cyril` and `/create_staff_invite @FinG`

You'll now get proper feedback about whether the DMs work and have manual links as backup! 🚀
