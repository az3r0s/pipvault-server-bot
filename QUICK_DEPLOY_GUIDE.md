## Deploy to Railway

### 1. Commit Changes
```powershell
cd pipvault-server-bot
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Bulletproof invite tracking persistence across redeploys"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Auto-Deploys
Railway will automatically deploy. Monitor logs for:
```
✅ Restored invite cache from backup
✅ Cached invites for guild: YourGuild
✅ Added invite cache to cloud backup
```

### 3. Verify After Deploy
In Discord, run:
```
/debug_invites
```
Should show all staff invite codes and tracking data.

### 4. Test Persistence
```
# In Railway dashboard, click "Redeploy"
# Wait for bot to restart
# Run /debug_invites again
# All data should still be there! ✅
```

## Rollback Plan (if needed)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```
Old system will be restored (but data will still be lost on redeploys).

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
CLOUD_API_URL=https://web-production-1299f.up.railway.app
# (Should already be set)
```

## Discord Permissions Required
- ✅ Manage Server (to view invites)
- ✅ Create Instant Invite
- ✅ View Audit Log

## Success Metrics
After deployment, you should see:
- 📁 `data/invite_cache_backup.json` file created
- ☁️ Cloud backups include `invite_cache` key
- 💾 Logs show backup confirmations
- 🔄 Data survives redeploys

## Support Commands
```
/debug_invites          # Check cache status
/refresh_invite_cache   # Force refresh
/fix_staff_usernames    # Sync usernames
```

## Test Results
