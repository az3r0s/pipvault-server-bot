# VIP System Fixes - Approval/Denial & Upload Privacy üîß

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Upload Screenshot Prompt Visible to Everyone
**Problem:** The "üî• Please send your email screenshot NOW!" message was showing in the VIP upgrade channel for everyone to see (`ephemeral=False`).

**Solution:** 
- Changed `ephemeral=False` to `ephemeral=True` in `ImageUploadModal.on_submit()`
- Now only the user uploading sees the prompt message

### 2. ‚ùå VIP Approval/Denial Error: 'GUILD_ID' Missing
**Problem:** When staff clicked approve/deny buttons, getting error:
```
'VIPUpgrade' object has no attribute 'GUILD_ID'
```

**Root Cause:** VIP cog was looking for `GUILD_ID` environment variable, but the bot uses `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`.

**Solution:**
- Updated VIP cog to use correct environment variable: `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`
- Added `GUILD_ID` attribute to VIP cog initialization

## Code Changes

### Privacy Fix - ImageUploadModal
```python
# BEFORE: Visible to everyone
await interaction.response.send_message(
    "üî• **Please send your email screenshot NOW** (within 60 seconds)!\n"
    "Just drag & drop or paste your image in this channel.",
    ephemeral=False  # ‚ùå Everyone could see this
)

# AFTER: Only user sees it
await interaction.response.send_message(
    "üî• **Please send your email screenshot NOW** (within 60 seconds)!\n"
    "Just drag & drop or paste your image in this channel.",
    ephemeral=True  # ‚úÖ Private to user
)
```

### Guild ID Fix - VIP Cog
```python
# BEFORE: Wrong environment variable
self.GUILD_ID = os.getenv('GUILD_ID', '0')  # ‚ùå This doesn't exist

# AFTER: Correct environment variable  
self.GUILD_ID = os.getenv('DISCORD_GUILD_ID', '0')  # ‚úÖ Matches main bot
```
