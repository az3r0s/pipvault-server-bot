## üîß **How It Works**

### VIP Upgrade Flow

1. **User Joins Server**: Invite tracker records which staff invite was used
2. **User Requests VIP**: Clicks "Upgrade to VIP" button in designated channel
3. **Account Type Selection**: User chooses existing account or new account
4. **Existing Account Path**:
   - Shows personalized email template with staff attribution
   - User sends email from Vantage account email
   - Staff verifies and approves
5. **New Account Path**:
   - Shows staff member's personalized Vantage referral link
   - User creates account using that link
   - User provides Vantage email for verification
   - Staff verifies deposit and approves

### Database Schema

#### Invite Tracking
```sql
CREATE TABLE invite_tracking (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    invite_code TEXT,
    inviter_id INTEGER,
    inviter_username TEXT,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Staff Configuration
```sql
CREATE TABLE staff_invites (
    staff_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    invite_code TEXT,
    vantage_referral_link TEXT,
    email_template TEXT
);
```

#### VIP Requests
```sql
CREATE TABLE vip_requests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    request_type TEXT,
    staff_id INTEGER,
    status TEXT,
    vantage_email TEXT
);
```

## üöÄ **Railway Deployment**

### Setup Railway Service

1. **Create New Service** in Railway dashboard
2. **Connect GitHub Repository**
3. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway dashboard
4. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically build and deploy

### Environment Variables in Railway

```
SERVER_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
VIP_UPGRADE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
VIP_ROLE_ID=your_vip_role_id
```

### Build Configuration

The `railway.json` file is already configured for Railway deployment:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "commands": [
      "cd server_bot",
      "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    ]
  },
  "start": {
    "command": "cd server_bot && python main.py"
  }
}
```

## üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**

### Staff Performance Tracking
- Total invites per staff member
- VIP conversion rates
- Pending request volumes
- Monthly/weekly performance trends

### System Health
- Bot uptime and response times
- Database query performance
- Discord API rate limit monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**Bot Not Responding**:
- Check bot token is correct
- Verify bot has necessary permissions
- Check console logs for errors

**VIP Upgrade Not Working**:
- Verify `VIP_UPGRADE_CHANNEL_ID` is set correctly
- Check if sticky embed exists in channel
- Ensure staff invite configurations are set up

**Database Issues**:
- Check database file permissions
- Verify database initialization completed
- Check logs for database errors

### Logs

Bot logs are written to:
- Console output (real-time)
- `server_bot.log` file
- Railway deployment logs (in Railway dashboard)

## ü§ù **Integration with Trading Bot**

This server bot is designed to work alongside the main trading bot:

- **Shared Database**: Can access same database for signal statistics
- **Independent Operation**: Runs as separate Railway service
- **No Interference**: Server features don't affect trading operations

## üìù **License**

This project is part of the Zinrai trading system and is proprietary software.
